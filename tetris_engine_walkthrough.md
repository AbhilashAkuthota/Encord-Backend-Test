Alright, let's walk through an example to solidify the simulation approach described in the attempted DSA idea for the Tetris engine problem.

Suppose we have the following line from the input: "L0, T2, I4, Q6". This represents a sequence in which four different Tetris pieces enter the grid: an 'L' shaped piece entering at column 0, a 'T' shaped piece at column 2, an 'I' shaped piece at column 4, and a 'Q' (square block) at column 6. Let's simulate the engine step by step:

Initialize the Grid:

We start with an empty 10-unit wide grid. The height (N) can be arbitrarily large but needs to be sufficient to accommodate all the pieces. Each grid cell is initialized to 0, representing an empty space.
Input Parsing:

The input line "L0, T2, I4, Q6" is parsed, and we understand it as a sequence of commands dictating which pieces will enter the grid and their entry columns.
Piece Placement:

We start by placing the 'L' shaped piece in column 0. Since the grid is empty, it will settle at the bottom.
Next, the 'T' shaped piece is placed starting at column 2. It will fall until it reaches either the bottom of the grid or rests atop the previously placed piece.
The 'I' shaped piece is then placed starting at column 4. It's a vertical piece, so it will occupy four vertical cells on the grid.
Finally, the 'Q' shaped piece is placed at column 6. Being a 2x2 square, if there are no other blocks beneath, it will settle at the bottom. Alternatively, it rests on top of other pieces.
Row Check and Clear:

After each piece is placed, we check for any filled rows. A row is full if all its cells are non-zero. If we find a filled row, we clear it by shifting all rows above it down by one. We repeat this until no full rows remain.
Height Calculation:

After all pieces have been placed and the grid is stable with no full rows remaining, we calculate the height. We do this by checking each column for the highest non-zero cell. The max height across all columns would be the overall height of the pieces on the grid.
Output:

We print the calculated height to STDOUT. If the input line resulted in two rows being filled, and the remaining blocks stack up to 3 rows in height, we would output "3".
To summarize, this example demonstrates the simulation of dropping Tetris pieces onto a grid, clearing filled rows, and calculating the final height of the remaining blocks to output. Each step in the process is critical to correctly modeling the simplified Tetris engine as described in the problem statement.
