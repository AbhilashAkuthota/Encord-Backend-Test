###This code sets up a battery of test cases for the Tetris engine that assesses its functionality, performance, and robustness. The run_tetris_engine function should be replaced by the actual function call to the Tetris engine simulation.

###Here are some key aspects covered by the test cases:

'''Basic functionality tests ensure that single piece placements result in expected row heights.
A test case to clear rows mimics normal gameplay where a row is filled entirely and should be removed.
Edge cases test the behavior of blocks near the boundary conditions of the grid.
Performance tests with repetitive inputs check if the engine can handle a large number of pieces without a memory leak or performance degradation.
Complex grid state tests determine the engine's behavior in non-trivial scenarios where multiple blocks interact.
Boundary conditions test whether placing a block at or beyond the grid edges is handled correctly.
Error cases force validation of input data, ensuring that the engine can gracefully handle invalid inputs without crashing.'''
