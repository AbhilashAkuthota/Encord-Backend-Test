###This Python implementation leverages the simulation approach to model how the Tetris pieces fall onto a grid, settle, and clear rows when appropriate based on the piece shapes and falling logic. The operations are broken down into functions for placing pieces, clearing rows, and calculating the height of the grid, with comments explaining the role of each specific function.

###Remember that in a real-world scenario, especially given the massive scale of input that the context suggests, streamlining memory utilization and optimizing for extremely large inputs would be necessary to avoid running out of memory. This code does not handle such optimizations directly but lays down a framework for a simulation pattern.
