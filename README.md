DSA Identified Pattern: Simulation

DSA Idea: The best pattern to solve the simplified Tetris engine problem is to use a simulation approach. Simulate the dropping of each Tetris piece onto the grid, updating the grid state after each piece is placed, checking for full rows to clear and letting higher rows fall into place.

Walk Through:

Start with an empty grid of 10 units width.
Parse given input to get the sequence of Tetris pieces and their entry positions.
For each piece: a. Determine the shape of the piece from its letter. b. Simulate the piece falling into place in the grid from its entry column. c. Once the piece is settled, check and clear any filled rows, simulating gravity for any rows above to drop down.
After all pieces are placed, calculate the resulting height of the remaining blocks.
Output the calculated height.
Test Cases:

Given "Q0,00", the expected output is "4", as the square fills four rows vertically in the first column.
Given "00,02", the expected output is "2", two squares on top of each other in the first and third columns.
-------------- Attempted DSA Idea END --------------

To solve the simplified Tetris engine problem using the simulation pattern, I would follow these steps:

Initialize the Grid:

Create a 10xN grid where N is sufficiently large to accommodate the pieces. Initialize all values to 0, representing an empty cell.
Input Parsing:

Read input from STDIN and split it based on commas to get the sequence of Tetris piece commands.
For each command, extract the Tetris piece type (e.g., 'Q', 'I', etc.) and its entry column.
Piece Placement:

For each piece, simulate the piece falling based on the piece shape and entry column.
Update the grid to reflect the placement of the piece.
Row Check and Clear:

After placing each piece, check each row starting from the bottom for fill status.
If a row is full (all cells are non-zero), remove the row by shifting all rows above it down by one. Repeat until no full rows remain.
Height Calculation:

Calculate the resulting height of the stacked pieces. This can be done by finding the highest non-empty cell in each column and taking the max of these values.
Output:

Print the calculated height to STDOUT after processing all pieces.
Time Complexity:

The time complexity is generally O(M * N) where M is the number of pieces and N is the vertical size of the grid, since each piece could potentially require a check through the entire height of the grid to place the piece and clear the rows.
Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(10 * N) which simplifies to O(N) since the grid's width is constant (10 units) and only the height N is variable based on the input. However, N should be chosen to accommodate the maximum expected stack height without causing index errors.
Note that N's upper bound might need to be estimated if not defined by input constraints, to ensure that all pieces can be placed without running out of vertical space on the grid. Additionally, in case of handling multi-gigabyte inputs, an approach to stream data in and out without keeping the entire input in memory would be necessary, but this pattern does not directly address such optimizations.
